## 1. Live "Process live" rotation review skips segments restored from a legacy staging manifest

**Status:** deferred (2026-07-03). Low impact, no data loss, transitional. Does NOT recur for
sessions created by the current build.

**Symptom (as reported):** After recovering an unprocessed live session and clicking *Process*, the
end-of-session rotation review showed only 2 of 6 pages — yet **all 6 files were output correctly**.

**Root cause (confirmed in code):**
- `LiveCaptureProcessor.finishSession()` builds `rotationReviewPages` from `retained.values`
  (`Capture/LiveCaptureProcessor.swift`, finishSession ~L470, `for seg in retained.values` ~L475). `retained` holds the per-segment inputs needed to
  regenerate a segment (source URLs, `OCRResult` incl. `rotationDegrees`, tags, model, …).
- `retained[groupId]` is written **atomically with every `staged.append(...)`** in `finalizeSegment`
  (`staged.append(...)` ~L261, `retained[groupId] = …` ~L263), so for any segment the current build finalizes, `staged` and `retained` stay in sync.
- The **only** way `staged` can contain a segment with no `retained` entry is `loadStagingManifest()`
  (~L108) restoring a **legacy-format** staging manifest — a bare `[StagedSegment]` array written
  before retained-persistence (commit `c0312f4`). The new format is `StagingManifest { staged, retained }`;
  the legacy branch restores `staged` + `finalizedGroups` but leaves `retained` empty for those segments.
- Result on recovery of such a session: legacy segments are re-staged/output (they're in `staged`) but
  **excluded from the rotation review** (not in `retained`), while freshly-processed segments appear.

**Impact:** minor. Output is correct — legacy segments keep the rotation that was baked when they were
first staged (auto-detected). The user just can't *manually re-review* those pages' orientation.

**Why not fixed now (the trap):** faithfully regenerating a legacy segment with a corrected rotation
needs its original `rotationDegrees` + OCR text + tags + model. A legacy manifest has none of these.
Reconstructing from `staged` + the segment JSON + `session.groups` still lacks the **original
`rotationDegrees`**, so regenerating a page seeded at 0° would *un-rotate* a page that had been
auto-rotated — strictly worse than today. So a naive "show all staged pages in the review" change is
unsafe unless regeneration is gated.

**Fix options for later:**
1. On legacy-manifest recovery, DROP those segments from `staged`/`finalizedGroups` so they're
   re-processed from scratch (re-OCR + re-tag → proper `retained`). Guarantees a complete review;
   cost = redoes OCR + re-prompts tagging for already-staged segments. Cleanest correctness.
2. Drive `finishSession` from `staged` (authoritative), include legacy segments in the review, but in
   `applyRotationReviewAndFinalize` **skip regeneration for any segment lacking `retained`** (they keep
   their staged output). Review is then complete, but rotating a legacy page does nothing — needs a
   clear UI affordance so it isn't confusing.
3. Persist `rotationDegrees` (and enough to regenerate) in the per-segment staging JSON going forward,
   so any future format gap is recoverable. Doesn't help already-written legacy manifests.

**Related, milder:** on recovery `session.resolvedGroupIds` isn't persisted, so already-staged document
groups can re-pop their tag card. No data harm — `finalizeSegment` guards `!finalizedGroups.contains`,
so re-saving is a no-op — but it's confusing UX. Seeding `resolvedGroupIds` from restored staged groups
in `loadStagingManifest` would fix it.

**Repro (approx):** stage a live session with an older build (legacy manifest) → force a restart so the
session is recovered → *Process* → *Finish session* with "Review rotation" on → review shows only the
segments finalized in the current run.
